Section 5. Warps
The warp module of uessentials allows users with the correct permissions to teleport to set locations, which are marked by people who have that permissions. First  We will discuss
permissions. The first permission is the permission to create, or set a warp in a specific place. >essentials.command.setwarp<. The comand usage is simple. Go to the place you want
to set the warp. Then do the command >/setwarp (warp name)<. After doing this, the warp will be set. Example >/setwarp Test<. This will create a warp called test. However, this will
only by avilable to admins. To fix this people need the permission to go there, however that will be talked about later. The next thing to talk about is >/delwarp<, which usage is 
same as >/setwarp< but replacing the set with del. Example >/delwarp test<. This will delete the warp called test. It is now time to talk about giving users the permission to go to 
warps. The first permission that is needed is to do the command >/warps<. This displays the warps you have acces to. The permission for >/warps< is >essentials.command.warps<.
When doing this a list will appear in the chat telling you which warps you can go to. The next permission is to do the command >/warp<. If the user doesnt have this permission
but has permission to go to warps, they will be able to see that they can go there but will not be able to execute the /warp command. The permission is >essentials.command.warp<.
This will only give permission to execute the /warp command. The next permission to look at is to give users permission to go to specific warps. If users only have the commands 
>/warp< and >warps< they will not be able to go to any warps due to not having any permission to do so. This is the permission >essentials.warp.(warp name)<. Example:
>essentials.warp.Test<. This will give users permission to go to a warp called test. Moving on to config of warps in the console, in the config.json file there will be a section for 
warps. It is below:
  "Warp": {
    "TeleportDelay": 5,
    "CancelTeleportWhenMove": false,
    "PerWarpPermission": true
Dissasebling this, the first line >warp< just says that this is the section for warps. The second line which says >teleportDelay<, tells the plugin how much to wait between the 
command being executed and the user being teleported to the warp. This is in seconds, in this configuration, the plugin will wait 5 seconds before sending the user to the warp. 
The next line which says >cancelteleportwhenmove<, shows the part of the config which tells the plugin, if to cancel the teleportation of the user, if they moved during teleportation. 
This only accepts True, or False variables. If set to true, when teleporting, the user has to stay still while being teleported. While if set to false, the user can move around while 
being teleported. The next line defines if the user needs permission for each warp they go to, or if they can have the permission to do the >/warp< command and will have acces to 
all warps. 
Here is an example of a working permission group which allows the users to create, delete warps as well as being able to see the arps they have acces to. This will also let them go
to the warp called "test".
