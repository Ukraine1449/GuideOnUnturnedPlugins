This is a project which aims to document most if not all public Unturned (Rocketmod LDM, Redoxmod, Rocketmod 4-5, OpenMod). It will have guides that shows what permissions, modules and uses each plugin has. I hope all questions can be answered and if not here is our discord if you would like to join and ask questions, we are happy to help. https://discord.gg/aytaSRu. The Project name is Nelson Is a Bot.
