Uessentials is an Unturned plugin which I would reccomend every Unturned server to have and use. It shares some simmilarities with the plugin EssentialsX from Minecraft, However
not much is shared between them other then what they try to acomplish. Uessentials is a plugin which has everything from moderation, to deathmessages enabling owners and developers
to have a lot of functionality and usability in 1 plugin. In the following pages I will discuss how to use, and what there is to uessentials. This is the first guide. I hope to add 
to this repository some information from others developers. Here are the current parts of Uessentials:
1. Moderation.
2. Auto Announcment.
3. Kits
4. Warps
5. Rules 
6. Join/Leave messages
7. Death messages.
8. Polling people in the server
9. Anti spam
10. Home/tpa
11. AutoCommands
12. Blacklisting things from /i and /v
Everything will be talked about with a section deicated to it. A final 2 sections will show how to use it and its perms.
